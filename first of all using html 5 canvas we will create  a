first of all using html 5 canvas we will create  a canvas .
now using canvas properties we can draw the snake  and randomly generate the food 
we will divide the whole canvas into boxes  for one unit  now every box will have x annd y coordinate 
we will create a context object which will provide us methods like strokerect  to draw the nake 
To track the snake we will store its coordinate in an array 

and we will create a function to draw the snake and we call it on fixed intervals setInterval to make the snake move 
using arrow keys we will control the snake .
the interval period will decide the speed of the snake .

controlling  the snake :-
we will have to add event listener on event  arrow key  press 
we have to pop  one element from the snake array  i.e  the last one and add a new head according to the direction (explain here)

snake eating food :-
when snake's head coodinates match with the food's coordinates the new head is added (and no element is popped in this case)and randomly food is generated  and score is updated .
otherwise add new head new head and pop last element

collison detection 
we will iterate over snake array and check if new head is not same as one of array elements , if true then game over using alert box show game over msg .
or if snake new head collides with boundary  i.e its coordinates are greater or equal to boundary the game is over 

for food
we have to randomly generate food within the boundaries of the canvas using rand() function
